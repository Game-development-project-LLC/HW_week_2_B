** Why portrait looks “bigger” **
- Orthographic camera’s Size = half the vertical world units visible.
- When you rotate to portrait, Unity keeps the same vertical span, but the screen becomes taller relative to width, so horizontally you see less world. Relative to the shorter side, objects appear larger/more zoomed.
